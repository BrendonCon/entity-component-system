## ISSUES
- How do we handle parenting?
- Dynamic wake/asleep system?
- Generate namespace file
- Need texture cache
- Some systems have update called even if no update functionality has been implemented
- Do we need managers? SystemManager, EntityManager, ComponentManager? PARTIAL
- Naming collisions, Particle Componet and Particle Prefab, don't want to be saying Prefab and Component everywhere although already saying system when naming systems, do we need name spacing?
- Object pool class? Use it in entity manager?
- Pick event system interface and stick to it
- Decorators?
- Add tick rate to systems to allow them to be called at different rates?
- Is priority for systems needed?
